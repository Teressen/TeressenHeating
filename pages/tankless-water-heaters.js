So, if you have hard water flowing, then mineral build-ups can damage the heat exchanger in your unit. Due to this, the efficiency of the tank could fail, and you could end up with a higher energy bill every month. Also, by not flushing your tankless water heater, the life expectancy of your heater will get shortened.</Typography>
